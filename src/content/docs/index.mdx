**atlcli** is a command-line interface for **Confluence** and **Jira**. Supports Atlassian Cloud (first-class support), Data Center, and Server installations.

## Confluence & Jira Features

### Confluence

**Core feature:** True bidirectional sync between local markdown files and Confluence wiki pages - edit locally in your favorite editor, push to Confluence, or pull remote changes. Conflict detection included.

**Extensive macro support:** Full conversion of Confluence macros to markdown and back:

- **Simple macros:** info, note, warning, tip panels, expand/collapse, table of contents
- **Complex macros:** code blocks with syntax highlighting, tables, task lists, layouts
- **Unknown macros:** Preserved as-is during sync - no information loss

### Jira

**Full issue lifecycle:** Create, search, update, and transition issues from the command line. JQL search with flexible output formats.

**Time tracking with timers:** Start a timer when you begin work, stop it when done - time is logged automatically. No more forgetting to track hours.

**Sprint analytics:** Velocity charts, burndown tracking, and predictability metrics for your agile workflows.

**Bulk operations:** Update, transition, or label hundreds of issues at once with JQL filters.
